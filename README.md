# FT_TRANSCENDENCE

In this module as a group of 4 programmers we had to develop a multiplayer pong game using web tools and languages.

# TASKS

The main purpose of this website is to play Pong versus other players. 
```
• Therefore, users must have the ability to participate in a live Pong game against another player directly on the website. Both players will use the same keyboard. The Remote players module can enhance this functionality with remote players. 
• A player must be able to play against another player, but it should also be possible to propose a tournament. This tournament will consist of multiple players who can take turns playing against each other. You have flexibility in how you implement the tournament, but it must clearly display who is playing against whom and the order of the players. 
• A registration system is required: at the start of a tournament, each player must input their alias name. The aliases will be reset when a new tournament begins. However, this requirement can be modified using the Standard User Management module. 
• There must be a matchmaking system: the tournament system organize the matchmaking of the participants, and announce the next fight. 
• All players must adhere to the same rules, which includes having identical paddle speed. This requirement also applies when using AI; the AI must exhibit the same speed as a regular player. 
• The game itself must be developed in accordance with the default frontend constraints (as outlined above), or you may choose to utilize the FrontEnd module, or you have the option to override it with the Graphics module. While the visual aesthetics can vary, it must still capture the essence of the original Pong (1972).
